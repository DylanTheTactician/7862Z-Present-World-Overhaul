# 7862Z-Present-World-Overhaul
7862Z's semi-automated robot code as of 1/28/2018. Includes match-load stacking, field-cone stacking, and automatic mobile goal intaking. The project started to slowly spiral out of hand, and so I've decided to make it public as I'm starting into a new system that should work better for our current robot. I may come back to this later if I make another, more consistent robot.
